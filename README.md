# The John Cena Phone Shamer
A website made for fun -- try picking up your phone in frame, and have John Cena question the intentions behind it.

The vast majority of digital well-being apps geared toward reducing screen-time operate at an app-level. I, however, have trouble at the inception point -- picking up my phone out of habit _because it's there_. Or because a moment of stress and overwhelm makes me reach for something reliably distracting. But the most nefarious -- sometimes I pick it up without even being conscious in my decision to do so. I dislike the feeling I get whenever I do anything without intention. This website was a fun and silly way to question the action of picking up my phone, asking myself _"Are you sure about that?"_

And are you, sure about that?
